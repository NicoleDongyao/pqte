Module to fit a causal forest.

This module provides functions to fit a causal forest. Most importantly it
provides the wrapper class ``CausalForest``, which can be used to fit a causal
forest, load a fitted model from disc, save a fitted model to disc and predict
treatment effects on new data.

class CausalForest:
    """Estimator class to fit a causal forest.

    Estimator class to fit a causal forest on numerical data given
    hyperparameters set in *forest_params* and *tree_params*.
    Provides methods to ``fit`` the model, ``predict`` using the fitted model,
    ``save`` the fitted model and ``load`` a fitted model.

    Note that the structure of this estimator is based on the BaseEstimator and
    RegressorMixin from sklearn; however, here we predict treatment effects
    --which are unobservable-- hence regular model validation and model
    selection techniques (e.g. cross validation grid search) do not work as
    we can never estimate a loss on a training sample, thus a tighter
    integration into the sklearn workflow is unlikely for now.


    Attributes:
        forestparams (dict):
            Hyperparameters for forest. Includes 'num_trees' (int) and
            'split_ratio' (in [0, 1]). Example:
            forestparams = {
                'num_trees': 100,
                'split_ratio': 0.7,
            }

        treeparams (dict):
            Parameters for tree. Includes 'min_leaf' (int) and
            'max_depth' (int). Example:
            treeparams = {
                'min_leaf': 5,
                'max_depth': 25
            }

        num_workers (int):
            Number of workers to use for the parallelization.

        _is_fitted (bool):
            True if the ``fit`` method was called or a fitted model was loaded
            using the ``load`` method and False otherwise.

        num_features (int):
            Number of features in design matrix that was used to fit the model.
            If forest has not been fitted is set to None.

        fitted_model (pd.DataFrame):
            Data frame representing the fitted model, see function
            ``_assert_df_is_valid_cforest`` for how a Causal Forest model is
            represented using data frames.
